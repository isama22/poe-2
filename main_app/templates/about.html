<h4><em>About Poe</em></h4>

<p>We believe creating a public domain where people can share their love for poetry is a great way for people to connect and collaborate based on a common interest.</p>

<p>But when it comes to it, well styled and well edited poems get seen by more people. However, there are many skilled writers who arenâ€™t equipped to style their poems with difficult editing software, which is where we come in.
</p>
<p>
POE allows users with novice editing skills create beautiful themes for their poems without having to use multiple external editing applications. With a few clicks the theme will be automatically applied to the the content of their piece. After that, the artist can save their work and start sharing it!
